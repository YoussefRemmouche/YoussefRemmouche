### Youssef Remmouche, Junior Frontend developer  🤙

Hello there, I'm Youssef! I am a very driven young man who loves challenges that make him grow every day on every aspect of his life. I recently graduated from [Jagaad Academy](https://academy.jagaad.com/)'s bootcamp as a frontend developer. I learned and practiced so many skills there, both hard and soft, but I am very aware of the fact that my learning journey doesn't stop here. In fact it doesn't stop at all! 
Here are some of the skills I'm talking about:
* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Javascript
* Typescript
* React
